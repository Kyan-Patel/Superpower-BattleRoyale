# Superpowers Battle Royale

Welcome to the Superpowers Battle Royale project! This project showcases my proficiency in Python programming, particularly in object-oriented programming and data handling, as well as my ability to design and implement simulations.

## Project Overview

The Superpowers Battle Royale project involves:

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Designing and implementing classes for heroes, villains, and specialized subclasses based on character attributes.
- **Data Handling**: Reading and processing data from a CSV file containing character attributes.
- **Encapsulation**: Protecting object variables using property decorators and setters to ensure data integrity.
- **Polymorphism**: Implementing methods that override parent class methods to conduct analyses of similar but different types of objects.
- **Simulation**: Simulating battles between characters to determine winners based on their attributes and bonuses.
- **Documentation**: Writing clear and concise documentation in the form of README files and docstrings to explain project details and code functionality.

## Skills Demonstrated

Throughout the project, I demonstrated proficiency in the following skills:

1. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**:
   - Designed and implemented classes such as `Hero`, `Villain`, `Child_of_Good`, and `Child_of_Evil` to represent different types of characters with varying attributes.
   - Utilized inheritance and polymorphism to create a flexible and extensible class hierarchy.

2. **Data Handling**:
   - Read and processed data from a CSV file using the `csv` module.
   - Extracted character attributes and instantiated objects based on the data.

3. **Encapsulation**:
   - Protected object variables using property decorators and setters to restrict access and ensure data integrity.

4. **Polymorphism**:
   - Implemented methods that override parent class methods to conduct analyses of objects with similar but different types.

5. **Simulation**:
   - Created a battle simulation algorithm to determine the outcomes of character battles based on their attributes and bonuses.
   - Conducted thorough testing and analysis to validate the simulation results.

6. **Documentation**:
   - Wrote clear and concise documentation in the form of README files and docstrings to explain project details and code functionality.
